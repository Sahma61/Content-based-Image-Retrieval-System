# Content-based-Image-Retrieval-System
<h1> A Content-based Image Retrieval System using shape and color features for Image ranking, written in python.</h1>
<br>
<h2> The following Project has been created as a part of Inormation Retrieval Course at IIIT Allahabad.</h2>
<br>
Shape feature extraction and ranking has been implemented as proposed in 1.<br>
Color feature extraction and ranking has been implemented as proposed in 2.
